# Instructions

From Roswitha.Bardohl@dagstuhl.de

Dagstuhl Manifesto:
===================

You can read at http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/dagstuhl-perspectives/ (and from your motivation text):

" ... Such a manifesto should include research directions that are put into a larger context, like its relevance for society and economy, applications, and relations to other fields. Its audience goes beyond the inner circle of experts and should include policy makers.
Dagstuhl's Scientific Directorate acts as editoral board for Dagstuhl Manifestos. Once a manifesto is accepted, it will be published in the series Dagstuhl Manifestos. Furthermore, manifestos are passed to national and European funding agencies. ..."

Please have a look at the boxes of the right-hand-side of the webpage http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/dagstuhl-manifestos/ where we provide a sample manifesto and in addition, a LaTeX-template and guidelines for the authors/editors.

A manifesto has about 15 to 25 pages. It summaries the status quo of the field and shows visions for future research directions. 
I don't know how much time you need to finish the Dagstuhl Manifesto, but I'd like to ask you to send it latest in the Middle of December, 2016. Is this feasible? - Please inform me if you cannot met the deadline.

I'd appreciate, if you support me with the distribution of the manifesto once it is accepted for publication by our Scientific Directorate. What I need are contact details (at least names and the institution) of important persons from funding/research agencies and a brief, appealing text for the letters our Scientific Director will sign when we send the manifesto. 

I assume that you and your participants know some important persons from funding agencies which could/should be interested in the outcome of your workshop. We would be glad if some of your achievements are taken into account when setting up new research programs!

Please note, that we would like to send cca. 20 printed and binded Dagstuhl Manifestos and unrestricted many manifestos via mail.
